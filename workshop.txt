description=Updates
description=2024-12-16 - 2.3 Sandbox options
description=[*]Make all modifiers variables changable in the sandbox settings menu on a new tab. You can now ignore the default design of this mod and play to your own rules, based on overwhelming demand to change behaviors. Default rules are based on zombie behavior in the show Kingdom.
description=2023-02-16 - 2.2 Behavior improvements
description=[*]change the way zombies are initialized. Because it seems zombies are created before buildings they were failing checks for closest building and being set to docile outside.
description=[*]when zombies are initialized they are immediately given a travel command.
description=[*]modify night routine to encourage more zombies to go outside. Improve logic that gives zombies commands.
description=[*]various code comment documentation updates
description=2023-02-15 - 2.1 Bug squashing and improvements.
description=[*]add function to calculate if a target is too far
description=[*]add function to lure zombies to a distant target helping in rural areas
description=[*]change some logic on daytime and night time routines to make zombies more likely to move and reduce false positive docile zombies outside
description=[*]change tick calculations slightly to make sure zombies are more likely to move
description=[*]add lure chance to static variables to allow spicing up night time by pushing a certain percentage of zombies outside
description=2021-01-07 - change target to avoid error spam.
